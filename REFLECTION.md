# Reflection

## Patterns or surprises
I noticed most toolkit functions are small and reusable, and many can be combined (like using isEven/isOdd inside other logic).

## What logic challenged your thinking?
Writing sumTo(n) required careful loop boundaries and thinking about what happens with small inputs.

## Real-world use
A toolkit like this could be reused in larger programs for validation, calculations, and consistent behavior across projects.
